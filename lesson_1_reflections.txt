How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It told me the lines that were removed and added. So I can compare specific parts of both codes and checked what went wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
by making versions


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
cons: human error
pros: flexibility

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
the files when coding might be related and might affect one another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat command gives the list of commits
Via git diff we can easily compare 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I dont have to worry about screwing up the whole project or saving an old working copy of it manually. This is just like taking a snapshot of a VM.
